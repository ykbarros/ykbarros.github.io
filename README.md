# Note to self
Master branch is served on kimbarros.com. The site is built using Jekyll; because of Jekyll custom plug-ins that aren't sanctioned automagically by GitHub when building and deploying the site, there are 2 forked repos:
1. `blog-staging` to commit work done; and
2. `master` to serve up built jekyll site (site built locally).
