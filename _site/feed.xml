        <title>I am going slow to go fast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Going fast and breaking things has become a ubiquitous phrase in product management, akin to the widely adopted Agile Manifesto. In fact, there are so many variations of this mindset. Fail fast and learn faster. Speed is a currency. Time to market is everything. Iterate quickly. Rapid prototyping. And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this need for speed, I’ve seen a lot of shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“You don’t need to talk to the users. Our team is the voice of the customer, and we’ve collected NPS results already.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We have to be agile. Start making some bets, build, and ship something so we can start learning.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Our competitors have already built it this way. This is the industry standard, and we’re already behind. If we don’t have the resources, I’ll find consultants on UpWork.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t truly agile, nor are they failing fast in order to learn and iterate. They’re just failing. It just feels palatable because it’s justified with Silicon Valley phrases and complete disregard for the survivorship bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptations to justify and succumb to the shortcuts are high. Even as I work on my personal project, I need to intentionally suppress the urges to skip the discovery process and beeline to a conclusion to show the world I’ve made meaningful, impressive progress: a &lt;em&gt;visible, tangible&lt;/em&gt; progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My antidote to meaningfully slowing down and appreciating the process is to reflect on the frequent shortcuts that have plagued my product development processes in the past. By doing so, I can take proactive steps to prevent these skips from occurring and ensure a more successful outcome for my current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, these are the steps that are frequently cut in a product development process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;: research and understanding user problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User testing and iterative design&lt;/strong&gt;: designing; testing through product validation with real users on the usability, functionality, and user experience; and refining the product in multiple iterations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QA and testing&lt;/strong&gt;: testing the product for quality and ensuring that it meets requirements and specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation and postmortem analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; analyzing the iteration, identifying areas of learning and improvement, and documenting for reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my current project, I’m straddling between the discovery, user testing, and iterative design phases. I’ve been feeling self-conscious when asked, “So you don’t have a concrete solution?” or, “So you’ve just been talking to people?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my pep talk I give myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I chose not to skip the discovery phase despite being told that “building a product is all about making bets.” Making product bets isn’t a shorthand to forgo the discovery phase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making bets not about declaring, “This is my belief. It may or may not work, and I’m going to bet on it to find out.” Instead it’s, “Here are all the potential possibilities of how this might shake out, and based on some limited information I have, I’m going to go down this path.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The discovery phase allows me to take calculated risks. The discovery phase increases the odds of winning the bets I make.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an invisible step to many, but it’s an important step for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living up to a core set of values is difficult. I’m often struggling to stick to them. I’m tempted daily to dismiss and downplay the discovery work I’ve done over the past three months because I don’t have a tangible product to show for it. Perhaps you feel the same way as you build out your product or your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to acknowledge and appreciate all the failed paper prototypes and ideas I’ve scrapped along the way, as they have refined my betting process and brought me closer to a viable solution: thank you, failures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Case study on a 4-step process towards problem discovery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My goal is to help people practice self-care in a meaningful way. However, before diving into product ideas, I needed to address several unknowns and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What exactly is self-care?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do people define self-care, both broadly and for themselves?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do people explicitly practice self-care?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there a significance in “meaningful” self-care?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we practice self-care meaningfully?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, I sought to understand self-care from other people’s perspectives. I followed four steps: research, define, chat, and refine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out with very simple search terms on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt; to find more comprehensive, specialized information, primary and secondary sources, and related research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/google-scholar-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;My first Google Scholar search term was &amp;quot;self care&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this exercise, I discovered many studies completed on self-care. For example, I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392422004699&quot;&gt;recent study from Journal of Pain and Symptom Management&lt;/a&gt; that examined the correlations among self-care, emotion regulation, social support, and well-being among young adults during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge was knowing when to stop this step and move to the next one. To mitigate, I gave myself a maximum of two days to explore and research before moving to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;define&quot;&gt;Define&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I identified recurring themes as I read academic journals and books on the topic. To keep track of my findings, I kept a research repository using Notion, where I recorded my takeaways, more details on the findings, and “key terms,” or words that frequently appeared in my readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/research-repo.png&quot; alt=&quot;My research repository in Notion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge was avoiding jumping to conclusions too soon. With reputable sources presenting multiple convincing findings, it was all too easy to get sidetracked and end up with numerous product ideas sprouting in every direction like dandelions in springtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/mind-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;My mind map of ideas&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;My haphazard web of self-care ideas during the process.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, I gathered up my write ups and key terms, noted key observations and reactions, and defined my hypothesis statements. This exercise led me to some unexpected realizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While I expected self-care to be strongly linked to mindfulness, self-reflection, and stress management, I found that routines and habits played a more significant role than I anticipated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contrary to my assumption that self-esteem would play a significant role in self-care, I discovered that self-compassion was a more common theme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social support and prosocial activities also emerged as important means of caring for oneself, which reminded me of the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu: “a person is a person through other persons” or &lt;em&gt;umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/word-cloud.png&quot; alt=&quot;Word cloud of frequent &amp;quot;key terms&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these realizations, I formed several hypotheses and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practicing routine self-care activities are more impactful than one-off “abortive treatments.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it comes to self-care, people are more attuned to “abortive treatments” to stop feeling bad as negative emotions are happening instead of “routine treatments” to become more resilient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practicing self-compassion is a key component in practicing self-care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practicing care for others can facilitate self-care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People want a sense of connection and fulfillment, but they might not perceive this as a form of self-compassion or self-care.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How someone defines a sense of fulfillment can vary wildly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People want to practice self-care. But they don’t know how and are employing different ways to “feel good.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After developing initial hypotheses, I sought out people through channels like Meetup, Reddit, Discord, Lunchclub, local networking events, and speed friending events. Before each conversation, I defined 2-3 things I wanted to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with these two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do people improve their emotional well-being in their daily lives?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do people start and maintain meaningful connections with others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent myself from making premature assumptions, I made a conscious effort to jot down direct quotes from my conversations with others and organized them on sticky notes in my Miro board. This was much more difficult with in-person conversations. I took multiple pauses to jot down notes during in-person conversations by saying, “Do you mind if I quickly write this down? I want to think more about what you just said,” before rapidly scribbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the “chat” step was the most difficult for me. You need to find an audience. You need to ask the right questions. You need to listen. You need to be open-minded. You need a little chutzpah to approach people and ask them personal questions–which means you need to be  vulnerable, too. It would be wildly unfair to go into these conversations as an interrogator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The least obvious challenge was knowing when I had sufficient enough data to progress to the subsequent stage. To address this, I set up two criteria for myself. The first was when I began to hear similar responses from various individuals. The second was speaking with six people. Whichever condition I achieved first was a cue for me to move on. I made six the cutoff because having fewer participants would not offer a wide enough range of perspectives. On the other hand, talking to more people would require a significant investment of effort and time while providing diminishing returns on insights gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;refine&quot;&gt;Refine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this step, I refined my understanding and hypotheses by gathering takeaways from my conversations with people, just like the “define” step where I gathered takeaways from my readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this initial cycle of research-define-chat-refine, I had conversations with five people and gained valuable insights. These conversations highlighted that people crave “genuine, authentic, and meaningful” connections in their lives, but it’s challenging to find and sustain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/findings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snippet of my findings from conversations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these insights, I was able to discover a problem and validate some of my hypotheses. For example, I started with the hypothesis that “people want a sense of connection and fulfillment, but they might not perceive this as a form of self-compassion or self-care.” This evolved into “Interconnectivity can improve self-compassion, fulfillment, and actualization. But people are afraid and ashamed of connecting and maintaining connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-am-i-now&quot;&gt;Where am I now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I established a weekly cadence of research-define-chat-refine, dedicating 1-2 days to each step. I documented my findings on separate Miro boards for each week, resulting in a total of five boards encompassing my problem discovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this iteration, I identified two key problems to further explore and develop solutions for. The first is how people can find interconnectivity while working a remote job so they don’t feel isolated and lonely. The second is how people can address the fear of rejection and shame often associated with forming and maintaining bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to go make another Miro board!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reasons why I am hesitant to share my ideas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I found myself scrolling through startup forums and noticed a common theme. People are notoriously protective of their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“My current concern is protecting my idea.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I have a really unique product idea, but I’m worried the big players will steal the product.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Should I copyright my idea before I approach investors?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Can I get people to sign an NDA before I start talking about my ideas?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get it. I am, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read any of my previous blog posts, you’ll find something suspiciously missing in my journey through problem discovery. I don’t mention the product ideas I’m currently pursuing. Why? Fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear or rejection: what if someone thinks my idea is terrible and shoots it down?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear of failure: what if my idea doesn’t work out and I look like an idiot?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear of judgment: what if someone tears my idea apart and thinks less of my skills and expertise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lizard brain and my defense kicking in, I know sharing ideas early and frequently is incredibly beneficial. By talking to other people, you can gain valuable insights and feedback that can help shape your idea into something more tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for idea thefts? Sure, you may be sitting on a revolutionarily unique idea (personally, this isn’t the case for me). But clever ideas still end up maturing in different forms. Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a means of talking the talk and walking the walk, I’ll lead by example and share my own hypotheses and problem discovery work from the past month as a case study.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discovering hidden user insights (Part 2: how to talk to people)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended a local networking event to meet new people for my undercover problem discovery work. My primary goal was to get people talking and learn about their current struggles and how they’re trying to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, I asked a lot of questions. People’s faces lit up, eager to share more. I was met with, “I’m glad you asked.” Or “Now that you mention it…” And “Funny you ask because…” Someone proclaimed that this was the deepest conversation they had had in recent history. (I started by asking, “so what troubles you these days?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to interrogate them in a one-sided conversation so I stopped asking. The roles reversed and they asked, “So what do you do?” I stumbled through my abstract. “I have a hard time being compassionate towards myself. I get very critical and it makes it difficult for me to practice self care. I want to see if this is a struggle shared by other people and see if there is a way to solve this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oh wow, that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s a tough problem to solve. Good luck with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, good for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;🦗 🦗 🦗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/sad-monkey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a sad, awkward monkey staring down at the ground&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-would-you-carry-the-conversation-from-here-on&quot;&gt;How would you carry the conversation from here on?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, there are four paths one can choose to take, in my order of preference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share how the problem affects me:&lt;/strong&gt; I can take a more casual approach and talk about how the problem I’m looking to solve affects my life. This could be a great opening to establish a connection and to get to know each other better, if they’re willing to reciprocate and empathize.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share my “why”:&lt;/strong&gt; I can expand on why I’m passionate about the problem I’m trying to solve. This could be another great way to build rapport and create a deeper connection without feeling like I’m building up to “the pitch.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share my process:&lt;/strong&gt; I can delve into my research and plans to tackle the problem. This could inspire ideas or creative solutions from unexpected sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shuffle Away:&lt;/strong&gt; Change the topic, walk away, or if the conversation is still salvageable, put your undercover user researcher hat back on and continue asking questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of my conversations last week, I reached option 4 within a few minutes and walked away. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, I wanted to respect their boundaries. Secondly, I interpreted the niceties as a lack of curiosity. It’s like dating: if they were genuinely interested, they would have been curious. If not, they weren’t interested in a meaningful way. That’s okay; I won’t force a conversation. However, there is another scenario to consider: maybe they didn’t know what to ask or how to keep the conversation going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-to-authentically-carry-a-conversation&quot;&gt;Ways to authentically carry a conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share first:&lt;/strong&gt; To build rapport and find common ground, start by sharing a personal anecdote to make the other person feel comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…but don’t monopolize the conversation:&lt;/strong&gt; My general rule of thumb is, if I start to feel like &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; getting too comfortable with my monologue, then I’ve gone on too long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice active listening:&lt;/strong&gt; Pay attention to nonverbal cues when communicating face-to-face. You can mirror their body language, repeat what the other person has said, and ask follow-up questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…and don’t be afraid of silences:&lt;/strong&gt; Active listening may not always mean you have a response ready. It’s okay to take a moment to think and process what the other person has said. A simple prompt like, “Tell me more,” can help you take the time you need without feeling uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask open-ended questions&lt;/strong&gt;: Open-ended questions allow more detailed answers, while closed-ended questions can be answered simply: yes or no. Even questions asking for specific info are closed-ended; for example, “What do you do for a living?” and “How are you doing today?” Both start with “what” or “how”, but are closed-ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Discovering hidden user insights (Part 1: undercover user research)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To avoid the pitfall of making assumptions when developing a new product, I opted for some undercover user research instead of building first and then adding scientific rigor to validate my idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-undercover-user-research&quot;&gt;What’s undercover user research?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I engage in conversations with people without labeling them as user research. I ask open-ended questions to gain insight into people’s needs and problems. I also call this the Meijer method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who didn’t grow up in the Midwest, Meijer is a grocery store. As a moody teenager whose parents didn’t speak English fluently, one of my least favorite things was acting as a “meat shield” for my parents when people started engaging in conversations while waiting to check out at the supermarket. Midwesterners love to spill the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; people to spill the beans. An informal conversation can be a cost-effective way to quickly gather insights. All that is required is the willingness to ask good questions and listen attentively for any valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five steps to help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List 3 goals you want to achieve with your research:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Start with a key assumption or hypothesis you hold. Validate it by determining what must be true for the assumption to be accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What do you want to learn about your users? What questions do you have about their behavior, needs, or motivations?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ensure your research goals are clear, so your research is focused and effective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan your locations wisely:&lt;/strong&gt; Get creative and resourceful to find people to speak to. Consider places where you can observe or talk to real people, such as a coffee shop, a networking event, a social event, or even online through social media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be authentic:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to be respectful and genuinely curious when engaging with someone else. Even if you have a goal in mind when entering a conversation, it should be based on genuine interest and an open-minded attitude. Don’t push the conversation; instead, just enjoy it. People often have an innate ability to detect if someone is not being genuine, spinning bullshit, or being too eager, so it’s important to be mindful of this and set aside research goals if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather first-hand accounts:&lt;/strong&gt; Take notes whenever possible. It is best to write down &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what someone has told you, rather than your interpretation. Themes and patterns may become apparent after your second or third conversation. This could help you adjust how you ask questions and delve deeper. However, try to avoid analysis and focus on gathering first-hand accounts for now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draw insights and create new hypotheses:&lt;/strong&gt; Observe, reflect, and draw conclusions from your primary sources. By taking a step back and looking at the big picture, you’ll be able to uncover broader insights that you may have missed if you had focused too narrowly too soon. In doing so, you can generate new hypotheses, assumptions, and questions for the next iteration of research and discovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>How do I develop and conceptualize a product if I don’t have a good product idea?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The early stages of product development are essential for the success of a product. The greatest challenge is to identify people’s problems and needs – this should be the starting point, not the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product conceptualization is the process of creating an idea for a new product. This stage is crucial as it helps to ensure that the product being developed meets the needs of the target customer. There are several methods and tools that can be used for product conceptualization, such as brainstorming, mind mapping, and customer research. Brainstorming is a great way to generate a large number of ideas, while mind mapping helps to organize and structure these ideas. I have used both for my self-care idea. They are helpful, but they have not brought me closer to answering the important questions: &lt;strong&gt;“Is this a problem for people? And how are they solving it right now?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-discover-a-problem&quot;&gt;How do you discover a problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot solve a problem until you first discover it. There are three ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, by leveraging your industry experience and knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; That is how Starbucks got its start. Howard Schultz had prior experience in the coffee industry, working as a salesperson for a coffee-bean supplier. After frequent trips to Italy, he noticed the popularity of espresso bars and the lack of specialty coffee in the US, which prompted him to start Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, by identifying a problem you want to solve for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; Blue Bottle Coffee was founded by James Freeman when he wanted to experience more variety in the way coffee is roasted and brewed to capture its complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, by talking to people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not mutually exclusive. Take Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. She had experience in the fashion and retail industry. She was also solving the problem for herself; with the lack of options for slimming undergarments, she used her knowledge to create Spanx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with her industry knowledge and problem identification, she completed problem discovery and product validation by talking to people. She sent out prototypes to potential customers in the early days of the company. She wore her prototypes under her clothes to test them out and gather feedback while she worked as a door-to-door salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my self-care product idea is a passion project, I have no industry experience or knowledge. I can identify some problems I want to solve for myself. This will act as my seeds. By engaging in conversations with other people, I will gain insights that will help me determine which fruits might blossom from the seedlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this week, I’ll talk to at least five different strangers about themselves, their problems, and their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to avoid startup pitfalls</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon several cognitive biases and made some poor decisions about what I needed to do next for my startup project in the past two weeks. I’ll share what happened and how you (and I) can avoid the pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do&quot;&gt;What did I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to work on accessible means of self-care, so I prioritized talking to people to better understand what I needed to solve. I reached out to my penpals and asked what they do for self-care; 19 people responded, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them mentioned journaling as a means of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t stop thinking about what kind of journaling app I will build after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brainstormed reasons why someone would want to have my journaling app over another. From this exercise, I produced a list of what my users will receive by using my journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make peace with my inner voice by letting me express my thoughts and feelings without the pressure or judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help me build emotional resilience by embracing vulnerability; labeling my fear, worry, and anxiety; and making small changes to handle them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow myself to feel more hopeful, connected, and grateful by taking the time to recognize the small moments of joy and positive energy, no matter how trivial they may seem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there on, I did a user journey exercise to see what kind of experience I should initially build. I turned the user journey flow into a low-fidelity sketch. Then I turned the low-fidelity into a high-fidelity one in Figma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/hi-fi-mocks.png&quot; alt=&quot;My high fidelity design mocks in Figma&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that I’m headed in the right direction, I sent out the prototype flow to get feedback. I’ve received positive responses, and started looking into a no-code/low-code solution so I can launch an MVP for validation. Some people told me that they prefer pen and paper, but I’m assumed they weren’t my target customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-many-cognitive-biases-did-i-fall-prey-to&quot;&gt;How many cognitive biases did I fall prey to?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I instantly &lt;em&gt;latched onto my idea&lt;/em&gt; after a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision. I gravitated to the first pattern I was able to discern and made my decision on what to build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability heuristic&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to base decisions on the most recent information without being relying on a comprehensive analysis of all available information. I asked one question: “how do you self-care?” Despite receiving numerous other ways that people listed for self-caring, I chose to ignore all of them and only look at journaling as a viable means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I got a way too invested in the idea and started doing a lot of work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escalation of commitment&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to invest more resource, time, or energy in a decision though nothing is indicating that you should. What I really got from my conversation is that people who write letters to me also like to write in a journal. Instead, I took it as some sort of sign and really ran with it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overconfidence effect&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to have excessive confidence in one’s own answers to questions. All the brainstorming and flowcharting exercises I did were solo activities. I posed the questions, and I answered them. I was satisfied I was on the right track, and kept pushing forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I carried on with people who reacted positively to my prototype and dismissed the others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms your beliefs while disregarding the contraction. It’s a classic; what more can I say?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-avoid-cognitive-biases&quot;&gt;How to avoid cognitive biases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create checkpoints&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Before you continue down a rabbit hole and further invest what precious time you’ve got, create frequent checkpoints. A checkpoint should include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listing assumptions you’re making with where you are and where you’re going.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coming up with questions that can validate your assumptions to be true or false.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reaching out to diverse perspectives and asking them questions for validation purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Based on the responses, evaluating what steps to take next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in video games, this helps make meaningful progress and it makes turning back to a last, good save easier (before you got absolutely ambushed because you killed too many cows for profit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your ego and don’t take things personally&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
When I was doing this discovery work as my job, I took all the feedback in stride. But because I got so rapidly hooked on the idea &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I felt like I had the momentum &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I had all this flurry of activity to show what I’ve done, I got very emotionally attached to what I produced. Here’s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I stepped away from the mess I made for a few days so that I can be more detached from the situation in order to better observe and evaluate what happened.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I reframed the situation in order to learn from the experience. Instead of feeling hurt by people who weren’t raving about my idea or feeling embarrassed that I derailed two weeks on this, I decided that it was a good learning experience I can write about so I can help others avoid the same mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I kept reminding myself failure is okay and expected. I agree it’s not the sexiest words of affirmation. But a consistent, stern, sobering self-reminder that I’ll fail more than get it right has been helpful to keep my ego in check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop being a doer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
“If you build it, they will come” is a disastrous trap. I didn’t use Google+ or Google Lively, and I won’t go to a meeting in the Metaverse. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table7.txt&quot;&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, as of March 2022, only about &lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt; of businesses survived after &lt;strong&gt;one year&lt;/strong&gt;. So why do so many businesses fail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: it’s because businesses were selling something that not many people wanted. So stop being so eager to build a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think, “But I need to go &lt;em&gt;fast.&lt;/em&gt; And what about the first-mover advantage? I need to launch my idea ASAP!” The first-mover advantage is an advantage gained by first introducing a novel product or service to the market. Examples include Gillette, Amazon and eBay. And Vine, MySpace, and AltaVista. While the first-mover advantage may create a sense of false urgency to “just build it,” this advantage means nothing if no one is interested in what you have to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;strong&gt;find out if people want it built first. Then they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How traditional product plans ruin startups</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Product managers love methodologies, frameworks, mental models, processes, graphs, charts, infographic. You name it, I’ve likely used it. In established organizations, having definitions around what needs to be done and documentation that is agreed upon by everyone involved helps to get the product built. But those familiar ways of doing things can damage a budding startup opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll name two commonly used ways of how product people work and why it doesn’t work for a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-product-development-process-and-planning&quot;&gt;1. Product development process and planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product development is often described as a series of steps taken in order to launch a product or a service. The development process takes a methodical approach in order to come up with ideas that work for customers and generate profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/prod-dev-proc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Product development process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-product-development-plan&quot;&gt;Creating a product development plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the linear, systematic approach to developing a new product, a product development plan may emerge in order to bring more order to the chaos. A plan usually includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;product vision&lt;/strong&gt;: This may include the purpose of the product, what the product should do, and the scope of the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;business case&lt;/strong&gt;: This may be explained using marketing surveys (e.g., NPS scores).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roadmap&lt;/strong&gt;: This may include a list of milestones and goals to hit, like go-live dates, as well as a breakdown of how the work will get done across multiple goals (or sprint planning against the epics if you’re inclined to use scrum terminology).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;2. The Business Model Canvas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product plan may be too much information to zoom in on. One of the popular one-pager templates that’s often suggested to entrepreneurs is The Business Model Canvas. This allows you or your stakeholders to have a quick glimpse at the viability of your business based on your idea. It’s a well-loved framework; so much so that popular ideation tools like Mural and Miro have it as a built-in template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/miro-biz-model-canvas.png&quot; alt=&quot;Miro&apos;s business model canvas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the canvas, you need to fill in each section with your go-to-market strategy by identifying the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stakeholders and partners,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steps towards customer activation,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pricing and revenue,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer segments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling points for customers, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engagement points for customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-product-development-plans-and-the-canvas-dont-work-for-startups&quot;&gt;Why product development plans and the canvas don’t work for startups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s too much uncertainty and the environment radically changes from day to day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Startups often have limited resources in time and money. So it’s imperative to validate your business model and product as soon as possible. The traditional ways of product launching is often rigid and time-consuming.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll end up spending a lot of your energy, attention, and effort towards guesstimating. A business model of a startup is often in flux as you try to find the right product-market fit. If you think your local weatherman is bad at forecasting, try coming up with your customer acquisition steps and the path to monetization. If you can do that accurately, please send me the numbers to the next Powerball drawing; please and thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Why orgcharts matter at startups</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a new venture requires getting a lot of things done. This means spinning several plates on any given day. You may have to sketch your ideas on paper one minute and talk to friends and family for angel investments the next. Spinning plates is impressive but exhausting. Creating an organizational chart helps to bring order to the plate spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-early-stage-you-can-see-what-youre-getting-into&quot;&gt;In the early stage, you can see what you’re getting into&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to size up a task at hand is to think backwards. Visualize what the end state will be and consider what is necessary to get to it. Rinse and repeat the process until you get to a smaller, bite-sized task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re going to host Friendsgiving, visualize what the event looks like. Eight friends gathered together, sharing a meal and playing games. For the meal, how much food is necessary? Once you have that figured out, how long will it take to prepare? If it’s too much on your own, then you can think of different solutions. Find a place that sells pre-made meal kits. Make it a potluck. Ask people to come earlier and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking backwards show up in multiple places. When I practice where to put flourishes in my handwriting, I first write out the words and visualize where I will flourish first before jumping straight in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/ty-calligraphy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My calligraphy practice page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solutions and ideas open up once you know what you’re getting yourself into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing up the orgchart is an exercise that assists you in thinking backwards. By drawing boxes and lines, you are able to visualize the different plates that exist. Before you jump into the deep end, orgcharts allow you to size up your venture and ask “am I ready to take this on?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-growth-stage-you-can-scale-without-hiring-mind-readers&quot;&gt;In the growth stage, you can scale without hiring mind readers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say diligence and luck pays off, and you’re in the growth stage. You can’t handle all the plates at this point. So which plate do you hand off? And how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to be in control is no joke. I’ve had colleagues who refer to their products as their “baby.” Even as they move up the ladder, I’ve seen egos bruised as their baby grows without them. I imagine this is worse when it’s your own pet project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an organizational chart, you can remove yourself from the equation. First, you can look at the chart to identify areas bottlenecking growth. Second, you can define what kind of roles exist within those areas so you know who to hire. Third, you can define expectations for the roles so the new hires know what they’re expected to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-orgchart&quot;&gt;My orgchart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my former bosses said to me, “Orgcharts don’t matter. It’s just boxes and lines. People matter.” I disagree. People matter, so boxes and lines matter. Orgcharts shed light on how we fit together. Without them, accountability erodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even before I began to think about my product, I came up with an orgchart. For now, I hold as many titles as Tom Brady, Lebron James, and Stephen Curry combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I noted responsibilities that exist within the departments. Finally, I highlighted key responsibilities that are imperative to do now. This exercise was to ensure that I can zero in on the most important work to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2023/orgchart-v1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of my OrgChart draft with highlights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this chart isn’t perfect or complete. That’s not the point. What I was able to visualize are the different crafts that must come together for me to dare, hope, and dream. And if I get lucky, maybe I’ll get to remove my name off the boxes on the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Startup lessons from immigrant parents</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a one-woman project feels daunting. I didn’t know where to start after declaring which problem I’d like to focus on. So I retreated to my childhood memory. What did my non-English speaking, immigrant parents do to start their businesses in the U.S.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, their success wasn’t quite the &lt;em&gt;American Dream&lt;/em&gt; tale that most republicans drool over. We wouldn’t have made their cut as the poster child of the “model immigrant” nonsense. They fought a lot. We struggled. I got so sick and tired of eating eggs every day that it took me over a decade to start appreciating them again. Here is what my parents did. This is where I’ll start, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;network&quot;&gt;Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helped that they didn’t start from absolute zero. They had help. They sought advice from their newfound friends in the Korean community. It wasn’t labeled as an “informational interview,” but it might as well have been. They got advice on pricing, known competitors, and how to bring in customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-risk&quot;&gt;Reduce risk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By learning from others’ successes and failures, they were able to fast track some of the work. To borrow phrases from gaming, they knew their opening hand and their “build order.” This was important for them. It enabled my parents to work on the right thing and reduced the risk they were taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wear-a-lot-of-hats&quot;&gt;Wear a lot of hats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had a penny for every time I heard my parents say “we can’t take time off. No one can keep the business going while we’re away,” I would be a millionaire by now. After I married into a family who also had a small business, I got to hear it in both Korean and Portuguese!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and my in-laws are extremely hard workers. They kept their shops open 7 days a week. They had a half day off on Thanksgiving. They worked on Christmas Eve. They wore all the hats at all hours. That was their problem. Even as they scaled, none of them thought much about which hat to wear. Or which hat to give away to someone else. A major fashion faux pas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to dream big. I don’t want to be employed by my project. I want to be the owner and founder.&lt;/p&gt;
