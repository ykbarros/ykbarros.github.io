            <p>My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced <em>yay-jee</em>, as if you’re ecstatic then mildly shocked). I’m most proud of the relationships I’ve built and teams I’ve helped–not in their delivery, but discovery: seeing people say yes to the right things is inspiring.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/pages/ty-cards.jpeg" alt="My thank you cards" />
<small><i>“I hope I’ve told you this before: you’re such a good manager. Having you as my
first manager I think I took that for granted but in my time since then I’ve gotten to appreciate…and I was so lucky to have you as my first manager.”</i></small></p>

<p>Previously, I was a Director of Product at Nexamp, a clean energy enterprise specializing in the construction and management of solar farms. During my time, I coached Product Managers to make informed product decisions. Together, we achieved cost savings through optimized OpEx, improvements in conversion rate, and opened opportunities into new markets to fuel growth.</p>

<p>Before Nexamp, I was the first product management hire for CollegeVine. I worked with the founders and VPs at Fidelity Labs to launch a B2B2C product that provides college application assistance. I also worked as a “0-to-1” product manager and subsequently worked on activation, retention, and product-led growth (PLG) after finding product-market fit (PMF). The work led to 15% WoW growth and improvements to the retention curve.</p>

<p>Before CollegeVine, I was the seed PM for the Merchandising Product department at Wayfair that opened their office in Berlin. I built new systems to improve in-house brand creation process and coached product managers, analysts, and QAs based in Boston and Berlin. I also worked for the Boston office where I worked with suppliers and several internal departments to revamp the product catalog structure and improved customer lead time, increased wholesale revenue, and optimized the warehouse and delivery network.</p>

<p>Beyond consulting and coaching product managers to enhance their product intuition, I frequently make small product bets and document my successes and failures in blog posts.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-writing-this-blog">Why am I writing this blog?</h2>
<p>In the early days of my career, I hastily put together an MVP for “product validation.” It stayed that way for several years, much to the disappointment of users. Along the way, I added every conceivable feature to the front page of the product. I have grown since then. The same goes for the philosophy behind creating product value and usability.</p>

<p>When I wanted to learn how to improve, I read a lot of helpful literature. But it was often too theoretical and not actionable. I gained a lot of knowledge about product creation, but it wasn’t useful when I was faced with real-world challenges. I needed more product intuition. And that comes with experience.</p>

<p><strong>This blog aims to document my experiences with the realities of product creation and management–including the times I get punched in the mouth.</strong> I know there are people who can relate: Dr. Frankenstein cobbling together a spaghetti-code monster, a zookeeper feeding HiPPOs, a border collie trying to herd the masses, Professor X trying to read minds, or an imposter left wondering, “maybe it’s a me problem.” You’re not alone.</p>
