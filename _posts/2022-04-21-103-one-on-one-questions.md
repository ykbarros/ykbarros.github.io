In my [previous post on how to hold one-on-ones]({%post_url 2022-04-12-one-on-one-with-examples %}){:target="_blank"}, I abstracted different conversations that may come up into categories and types. As a refresher, I've noted them again here.

| Categories | Types |
| ----- | ----- |
| Check-in | Work progress |
| Check-in | Employee engagement |
| Check-in | Mental and physical well-being |
| Discussions | Company and team goals |
| Discussions | Relationship management |
| Feedback | Continued growth and development |
| Feedback | Performance goals |
| Feedback | Upward to manager |
| Feedback | Upward to organization |


Based on this distillation, I've put together 103 questions that can be used in your one-on-ones with your direct report. If you'd like more actionable posts to add to your manager toolkit, [subscribe to receive notifications](https://airtable.com/shrqyi0V7M1NZC58L){:target="_blank"}.
