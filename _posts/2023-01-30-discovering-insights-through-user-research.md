To avoid the pitfall of making assumptions when developing a new product, I opted for some undercover user research instead of building first and then adding scientific rigor to validate my idea.

## What’s undercover user research?

I engage in conversations with people without labeling them as user research. I ask open-ended questions to gain insight into people’s needs and problems. I also call this the Meijer method.

For those who didn't grow up in the Midwest, Meijer is a grocery store. As a moody teenager whose parents didn't speak English fluently, one of my least favorite things was acting as a "meat shield" for my parents when people started engaging in conversations while waiting to check out at the supermarket. Midwesterners love to spill the beans.

You *want* people to spill the beans. An informal conversation can be a cost-effective way to quickly gather insights. All that is required is the willingness to ask good questions and listen attentively for any valuable information.

Here are five steps to help you get started:

1. **List 3 goals you want to achieve with your research:**
    - Start with a key assumption or hypothesis you hold. Validate it by determining what must be true for the assumption to be accurate.
    - What do you want to learn about your users? What questions do you have about their behavior, needs, or motivations?
    - Ensure your research goals are clear, so your research is focused and effective.
2. **Plan your locations wisely:** Get creative and resourceful to find people to speak to. Consider places where you can observe or talk to real people, such as a coffee shop, a networking event, a social event, or even online through social media.
3. **Be authentic:** It's important to be respectful and genuinely curious when engaging with someone else. Even if you have a goal in mind when entering a conversation, it should be based on genuine interest and an open-minded attitude. Don't push the conversation; instead, just enjoy it. People often have an innate ability to detect if someone is not being genuine, spinning bullshit, or being too eager, so it's important to be mindful of this and set aside research goals if needed.
4. **Gather first-hand accounts:** Take notes whenever possible. It is best to write down *exactly* what someone has told you, rather than your interpretation. Themes and patterns may become apparent after your second or third conversation. This could help you adjust how you ask questions and delve deeper. However, try to avoid analysis and focus on gathering first-hand accounts for now.
5. **Draw insights and create new hypotheses:** Observe, reflect, and draw conclusions from your primary sources. By taking a step back and looking at the big picture, you'll be able to uncover broader insights that you may have missed if you had focused too narrowly too soon. In doing so, you can generate new hypotheses, assumptions, and questions for the next iteration of research and discovery.
