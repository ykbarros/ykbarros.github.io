“If you build it, they will come” is a disastrous trap. I didn’t use Google+ or Google Lively, and I won’t go to a meeting in the Metaverse. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table7.txt), as of March 2022, only about **80%** of businesses survived after **one year**. In this writeup, I’m going to dive into two traditional ways of product development and why they doom budding projects.

## What is product development?
Product development is often described as a series of steps taken in order to launch a product or a service. The development process takes a methodical approach in order to come up with ideas that work for customers and generate profit.

## Creating a product development plan
In the linear, systematic approach to developing a new product, a product development plan may emerge in order to bring more order to the chaos. A plan usually includes:

- **product vision**: This may include the purpose of the product, what the product should do, and the scope of the product.
- **business case**: This may be explained using marketing surveys (e.g., NPS scores).
- **roadmap**: This may include a list of milestones and goals to hit, like go-live dates, as well as a breakdown of how the work will get done across multiple goals (or sprint planning against the epics if you’re inclined to use scrum terminology).

## Following “The Business Model Canvas”
A product plan may be too much information to zoom in on. One of the popular one-pager templates that’s often suggested to entrepreneurs is The Business Model Canvas. This allows you or your stakeholders to have a quick glimpse at the viability of your business based on your idea. It’s a well-loved framework; so much so that popular ideation tools like Mural and Miro have it as a built-in template.

To complete the canvas, you need to fill in each section with your go-to-market strategy by identifying the following:
1. Stakeholders and partners,
2. Steps towards customer activation,
3. Pricing and revenue,
4. Customer segments
5. Selling points for customers, and
6. Engagement points for customers.

## Why product development plans and the canvas don’t work for startups
Both methods assume something huge: There’s a market segment that has a problem and wants a solution. *Your solution.* This is a dangerous assumption to make even for established businesses trying to introduce a new offering to their existing, captured market. Nevermind a new business trying to build a new product.

**“But what about the first-mover advantage? I need to launch now!”** The first-mover advantage is an advantage gained by first introducing a novel product or service to the market. Examples include Gillette, Amazon and eBay. And Vine, MySpace, and AltaVista. While the first-mover advantage may create a sense of false urgency to “just build it,” this advantage means nothing if no one is interested in what you have to sell.

If anything, it should be more like find out if they want it built first, then they might come. The great news is that this is a much lighter load to bear than building something, hoping for the best, and folding. More on that later.
