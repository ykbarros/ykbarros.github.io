I was determined and inspired by the vision of creating meaningful connections and combating the pervasive issue of loneliness. Instead of building a solution, I defined the target audience and what problem I wanted to solve. This led me to conversations with potential early adopters to explore their needs and challenges.

To do this, I went old school: Markers, crayons, pen, and paper to create paper prototypes.

During the testing phase, I stumbled upon a different problem, leading me to reevaluate my original direction. I want to share my journey of product discovery, insights gained from my exploration, and why I made the decision to pivot away from my initial idea.

## Chasing and validating my north star

At the heart of my vision was the desire to build a platform that fostered authentic human connections and helped individuals combat the profound sense of loneliness prevalent in today's digital age.

Initially, I believed that remote workers would be the ideal early adopters for my platform. With the increasing number of workers transitioning to remote setups, the traditional water cooler conversations that often foster friendships were fading away. I saw an opportunity to bridge the gap and create a sense of local connection among remote workers. However, as I engaged with potential users and tested my prototypes, I discovered a more pressing problem that most remote workers faced: the utility of networking for securing new job opportunities or acquiring clients.

## The misalignment and the decision to pivot

This revelation forced me to address the misalignment between the problem I uncovered and my vision of combating loneliness through meaningful relationships. While the networking issue was urgent and had its own merits, it didn’t directly address the deeper issue I initially set out to solve. This realization prompted me to reevaluate my direction and consider the insights from the references I had explored.

In light of the misalignment, I found myself at a crossroads: should I pivot towards the new, “hair on fire” problem or stay true to my original vision of combatting loneliness through meaningful connections? Ultimately, my true passion lies in authentic connections and addressing the core issue of loneliness; pursuing a different problem would dilute my purpose and impact. So I decided to pivot away from my idea to realign with my core mission.

## Giving up, perseverance, and staying grounded

This reads like an admission of defeat. After all, I’m left with receipts from Starbucks gift cards, paper prototypes, and a declaration that I’m putting an end to my current endeavor by pivoting away.

And I see this as a big win for me.

We love the hero’s journey who triumphs through it all. Their unwavering grit, tenacity, and perseverance against adversity. But spotting the unworkable that lies somewhere between your dreams, fears, and reality is a valuable trait.

So, as I conclude another chapter on what some may call failure, I’m going to embrace the valuable lessons learned, the insights gained, and the resilience that drives me forward. And remind myself: while it feels like I’m a failure now, this will lead to a different opportunity to create something truly impactful.

Failure isn’t a final destination. It’s just a stepping stone on the path to growth and discovery. And by letting go, I can open up and shape my journey in unexpected ways.
