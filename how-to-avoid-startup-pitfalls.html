                <p>I stumbled upon several cognitive biases and made some poor decisions about what I needed to do next for my startup project in the past two weeks. I’ll share what happened and how you (and I) can avoid the pitfalls.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What did I do?</h2>
<p>I’ve wanted to work on accessible means of self-care, so I prioritized talking to people to better understand what I needed to solve. I reached out to my penpals and asked what they do for self-care; 19 people responded, and <em>all</em> of them mentioned journaling as a means of self-care.</p>

<p>I couldn’t stop thinking about what kind of journaling app I will build after that.</p>

<p>I brainstormed reasons why someone would want to have my journaling app over another. From this exercise, I produced a list of what my users will receive by using my journal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make peace with my inner voice by letting me express my thoughts and feelings without the pressure or judgment.</li>
  <li>Help me build emotional resilience by embracing vulnerability; labeling my fear, worry, and anxiety; and making small changes to handle them.</li>
  <li>Allow myself to feel more hopeful, connected, and grateful by taking the time to recognize the small moments of joy and positive energy, no matter how trivial they may seem.</li>
</ul>

<p>From there on, I did a user journey exercise to see what kind of experience I should initially build. I turned the user journey flow into a low-fidelity sketch. Then I turned the low-fidelity into a high-fidelity one in Figma.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/posts/2023/hi-fi-mocks.png" alt="My high fidelity design mocks in Figma" /></p>

<p>To ensure that I’m headed in the right direction, I sent out the prototype flow to get feedback. I’ve received positive responses, and started looking into a no-code/low-code solution so I can launch an MVP for validation. Some people told me that they prefer pen and paper, but I’m assumed they weren’t my target customer.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-cognitive-biases-did-i-fall-prey-to">How many cognitive biases did I fall prey to?</h2>
<p><strong>I instantly <em>latched onto my idea</em> after a <em>single</em> question.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Anchoring</strong> is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision. I gravitated to the first pattern I was able to discern and made my decision on what to build.</li>
  <li><strong>Availability heuristic</strong> is the tendency to base decisions on the most recent information without being relying on a comprehensive analysis of all available information. I asked one question: “how do you self-care?” Despite receiving numerous other ways that people listed for self-caring, I chose to ignore all of them and only look at journaling as a viable means.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I got a way too invested in the idea and started doing a lot of work.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Escalation of commitment</strong> is the tendency to invest more resource, time, or energy in a decision though nothing is indicating that you should. What I really got from my conversation is that people who write letters to me also like to write in a journal. Instead, I took it as some sort of sign and really ran with it.</li>
  <li><strong>Overconfidence effect</strong> is the tendency to have excessive confidence in one’s own answers to questions. All the brainstorming and flowcharting exercises I did were solo activities. I posed the questions, and I answered them. I was satisfied I was on the right track, and kept pushing forward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I carried on with people who reacted positively to my prototype and dismissed the others.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> is the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms your beliefs while disregarding the contraction. It’s a classic; what more can I say?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-avoid-cognitive-biases">How to avoid cognitive biases</h2>
<p><strong>Create checkpoints</strong> <br />
Before you continue down a rabbit hole and further invest what precious time you’ve got, create frequent checkpoints. A checkpoint should include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Listing assumptions you’re making with where you are and where you’re going.</li>
  <li>Coming up with questions that can validate your assumptions to be true or false.</li>
  <li>Reaching out to diverse perspectives and asking them questions for validation purposes.</li>
  <li>Based on the responses, evaluating what steps to take next.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like in video games, this helps make meaningful progress and it makes turning back to a last, good save easier (before you got absolutely ambushed because you killed too many cows for profit).</p>

<p><strong>Check your ego and don’t take things personally</strong> <br />
When I was doing this discovery work as my job, I took all the feedback in stride. But because I got so rapidly hooked on the idea <em>and</em> I felt like I had the momentum <em>and</em> I had all this flurry of activity to show what I’ve done, I got very emotionally attached to what I produced. Here’s what I did:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I stepped away from the mess I made for a few days so that I can be more detached from the situation in order to better observe and evaluate what happened.</li>
  <li>I reframed the situation in order to learn from the experience. Instead of feeling hurt by people who weren’t raving about my idea or feeling embarrassed that I derailed two weeks on this, I decided that it was a good learning experience I can write about so I can help others avoid the same mistake.</li>
  <li>I kept reminding myself failure is okay and expected. I agree it’s not the sexiest words of affirmation. But a consistent, stern, sobering self-reminder that I’ll fail more than get it right has been helpful to keep my ego in check.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stop being a doer</strong> <br />
“If you build it, they will come” is a disastrous trap. I didn’t use Google+ or Google Lively, and I won’t go to a meeting in the Metaverse. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table7.txt">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, as of March 2022, only about <strong>80%</strong> of businesses survived after <strong>one year</strong>. So why do so many businesses fail?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: it’s because businesses were selling something that not many people wanted. So stop being so eager to build a solution.</p>

<p>You may think, “But I need to go <em>fast.</em> And what about the first-mover advantage? I need to launch my idea ASAP!” The first-mover advantage is an advantage gained by first introducing a novel product or service to the market. Examples include Gillette, Amazon and eBay. And Vine, MySpace, and AltaVista. While the first-mover advantage may create a sense of false urgency to “just build it,” this advantage means nothing if no one is interested in what you have to sell.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>find out if people want it built first. Then they <em>might</em> come.</strong></p>
