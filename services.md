## Building a successful product team is hard.
Finding the right "doers" and "doer-managers" can boost growth. As a business owner, your intuition and bias for action got the business to scale. But it's tough to know when and how to delegate work to a product team that can make the right decisions.

## I can help.
Your team will gain fresh perspectives and insights on how to work together. By working together, you and the team will grow confident in the product leadership, foster trust, and be motivated to see what you'll achieve next.

## Why should you trust me?
1. I have real-world experience in both product successes *and failures*. I can make sure your team doesn't fall into a trap with actionable guidance.
2. Many product managers work with OKRs, KPIs, and quarterly roadmaps. Going from this formality to the land of the unknown is a big culture shock. I should know: I've been there. And I have experience progressively introducing the structures necessary to foster greater collaboration.
3. I genuinely want to help. I've always taken my product leader role seriously. I don't want to stop at mentorship. I coach. I sponsor.
