## Building a successful product is hard.
As a leader, your intuition and bias for action delivered results. Taking the next step in growth means hiring and delegating. But it's tough to know who to hire when and how to delegate work to a team that can be trusted to make the right decisions.

## I can help.
I've launched successful products and built teams from the ground up, introduced product thinking to c-suite executives, and onboarded mom and pop stores, major B2B vendors, and even high school students onto platforms I've managed. With experience navigating the ups and downs of multiple startup stages, I can help your organization establish a robust product management presence and achieve success.

## Why should you trust me?
1. I have real-world experience in both product successes *and failures*. I can make sure your team doesn't fall into a trap with actionable guidance.
2. Many product managers work with OKRs, KPIs, and quarterly roadmaps. Going from this formality to the land of the unknown is a big culture shock. I should know: I've been there. And I have experience progressively introducing the structures necessary to foster greater collaboration.
3. I genuinely want to help.
