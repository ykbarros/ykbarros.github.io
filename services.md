## Growing your product intuition is hard.
Building a product takes more than achieving product-market fit. As a product matures, the team must continuously refine their intuition through collaboration, research, and strategy evaluation. While that's rewarding, it can also be stressful and confusing. As someone who's been there, I can offer my perspectives and help.

## I got you.
With each consulting and coaching engagement, your team will build up their product muscles and develop skills they need to make informed decisions on what to do and why in order to drive growth and engagement. As we approach problems together, you and the team will find new ways to work effectively beyond the Agile platitudes.

## Why should you trust me?
I've launched successful products and built teams from the ground up, introduced iterative product thinking to c-suite executives, and onboarded mom and pop stores, major B2B vendors, and even high school students onto platforms I've managed. But most importantly, I have real-world experience in both product successes *and failures*. I can make sure your team doesn't fall into a trap with actionable guidance.
