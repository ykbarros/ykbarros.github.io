My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, as if you're ecstatic then mildly shocked). For the past 10+ years, I have been working in tech and product management. Currently, I am exploring ways to improve self-care practices, document my successes and failures through my blog, and provide [product consulting services](#for-hire) to emergent startups.

## Why am I writing this blog?
In the early days of my career, I hastily put together an MVP for product validation. It stayed that way for several years, much to the disappointment of users. I added every conceivable feature to the front page of an internal product. I have grown since then. The same goes for the philosophy behind creating product value and usability.

When I wanted to learn how to improve, I read a lot of helpful literature. But it was often too theoretical and not actionable. I gained a lot of knowledge about product creation, but it wasn't useful when I was faced with real-world challenges.

**This blog aims to document my experiences with the realities of product creation and management‚Äìincluding the times I get punched in the mouth.** I know there are people who can relate: Dr. Frankenstein cobbling together a spaghetti-code monster, a zookeeper feeding HiPPOs, a border collie trying to herd the masses, Professor X trying to read minds, or an imposter left wondering, "maybe it's me." You're not alone. I hope you find this blog useful. Thank you for taking the time to read my writing and thoughts.

## Why should you hire me?
Product management is a complex and dynamic process that requires a deep understanding of the customer and their needs. Theoretical understanding of business practices isn't enough to deliver a successful product. Hiring an experienced product consultant offers a more specialized skill set, providing a better chance of success in bringing your product to market.

A seasoned product consultant has hands-on experience in the industry and understands the nuances of product development. They bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise, including market trends, competition analysis, and the latest product development methodologies. This level of understanding and expertise helps to ensure that your product will not only meet the market's needs, but also stand out from the competition.

Ultimately, a product consultant is dedicated to helping you achieve your goals by providing you with actionable insights and guidance. With their focus on product development, they bring a unique perspective to the table and are able to provide solutions that are specifically tailored to your needs. So, if you want to bring your product to market with confidence and success, consider hiring an experienced product consultant.
