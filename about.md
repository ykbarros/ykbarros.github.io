Hello world. My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, like you're ecstatic then disappointed). I stumbled into product management after a stint as a consultant about 10 years ago. I've had the pleasure of collaborating on B2B, B2C, internal products, and 0 to 1 products. In this time, I noticed that paths to success in this role are varied and opaque.  

I consider myself a forever student. I plan to fill this space as I take on new challenges with a side project I'm working on. The hope is that the vignettes serve as examples of what to do (or what not to do). You'll find help, compassion, and relatable tidbits for your product journey.

I can't wait to exchange my stories, mishaps, successes, and learnings with you.

*Thanks for reading and investing your time with my writing and thoughts!*
