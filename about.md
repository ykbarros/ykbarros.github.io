Hello world. My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, like you're ecstatic then mildly shocked). I spent the past 10+ years working in tech and product management.

In the early days of my career, I *frankensteined* a .NET application. I built an everything-*and*-the-kitchen-sink on the front page of an internal product. I've evolved since then. So has the philosophy behind delivering product value and usability.

**This blog is meant to serve as a guide** for anyone who's presently cosplaying as Dr. Frankenstein, a Zookeeper feeding HiPPOs, a border collie trying to herd, Professor X trying to read minds, the imposter who's acting real sussy...I hope you find it useful, and thanks for reading and investing your time with my writing and thoughts.
