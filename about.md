Obligatory "hello world!" My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, like you're ecstatic then disappointed). I've worked in Product Management and Consulting. In this time, I experienced a roller coaster of emotions from my leadership teams. I saw context and trust strengthen my relationship with my direct reports. I'll share the journeys here.

You'll find practical ways to exercise lateral, upward, and downward management. You'll find help, compassion, and a sounding board for *your* leadership journey ahead. And summaries and analyses on the latest topics in leadership.

I can't wait to exchange my stories, mishaps, successes, and learnings with you.

Finally: reading is an intimate, intentional act of connecting. *Thanks for reading and investing your time with my writing and thoughts.*
