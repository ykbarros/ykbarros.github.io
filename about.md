Hello. My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, as if you're ecstatic then mildly shocked). For the past 10+ years, I have been working in tech and product management. Currently, I am exploring ways to improve self-care practices, document my successes and failures through my blog, and provide [product consulting services](\services) to emergent startups.

## Why am I writing this blog?
In the early days of my career, I hastily put together an MVP for product validation. It stayed that way for several years, much to the disappointment of users. I added every conceivable feature to the front page of an internal product. I have grown since then. The same goes for the philosophy behind creating product value and usability.

When I wanted to learn how to improve, I read a lot of helpful literature. But it was often too theoretical and not actionable. I gained a lot of knowledge about product creation, but it wasn't useful when I was faced with real-world challenges.

**This blog aims to document my experiences with the realities of product creation and managementâ€“including the times I get punched in the mouth.** I know there are people who can relate: Dr. Frankenstein cobbling together a spaghetti-code monster, a zookeeper feeding HiPPOs, a border collie trying to herd the masses, Professor X trying to read minds, or an imposter left wondering, "maybe it's me." You're not alone. I hope you find this blog useful. Thank you for taking the time to read my writing and thoughts.
