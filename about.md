Obligatory "hello world!" My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, like you're ecstatic then disappointed). I've worked in Product Management and Consulting. In this time, I experienced a roller coaster of emotions from my leadership teams. I saw context and trust strengthen my relationship with my direct reports.

The fact that you're here means 1 of the following:
1. I plugged my link and piqued some curiosity.
2. You're married to me and thus have no choice.
3. My crash course on SEO strategy paid dividends and you're vetting me so you can become a better leader.

In an ideal world, you're here because 3. If so, welcome.

I can't wait to share my stories, mishaps, successes, and learnings with you.

*Thanks for reading!*
