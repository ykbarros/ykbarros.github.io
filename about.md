Obligatory "hello world!" My name is Yeji Kim-Barros (pronounced *yay-jee*, like you're ecstatic then disappointed). I've worked in Product Management and Consulting for the past 10 years. In this time, I experienced a roller coaster of emotions from my leadership teams. I saw context and trust strengthen my relationship with my direct reports. I will share my journey here.

You'll find practical ways to exercise lateral, upward, and downward management. You'll find help, compassion, and a sounding board for *your* leadership journey ahead. You'll find summaries and my interpretations on the latest topics in leadership.

I can't wait to exchange my stories, mishaps, successes, and learnings with you.

*Thanks for reading and investing your time with my writing and thoughts!*
