        <title>How to hold your first one-on-one meeting (with templates)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When you feel overwhelmed with meetings and you’ve got the case of zoom fatigue, you may be tempted to dismiss the 1:1 meetings with your teams. I’d like to make a case for why they belong in your work day. I’ll first share why and how you should hold your very first 1:1 and explore how to hold recurring 1:1s. If you’re still not convinced, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt;. I’d love to understand more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-purpose-of-a-one-on-one&quot;&gt;What’s the purpose of a one-on-one?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1:1 meeting (one-on-one? one-to-one?) is for coaching, alignment, and increasing mutual understanding. One-on-ones can take many shapes. Sometimes, it’s a helpline. Other times, it’s a vent session. One shape isn’t better than the other. After all, who’s to say an octagon is better than a dodecahedron?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word to the wise: If you’re feeling indifferent about a one-on-one, then your direct report is either equally indifferent or &lt;em&gt;dreading&lt;/em&gt; it. Having to force a relationship with someone who doesn’t care about you is hell. But feeling stuck in having no choice but to force the relationship because they seem to hold all the power is a special kind of hell. So shape it with some satisfying arcs and edges. As an example of what to do (and what not to do), &lt;a href=&quot;/why-have-one-on-one-meetings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read about my experience with former managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when should you have your first one-on-one with your direct report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The day you start managing the direct report.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This week if you already have a direct report you’ve managed for weeks/months/years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-goals-for-your-first-one-on-one-with-a-direct-report&quot;&gt;What are the goals for your first one-on-one with a direct report?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning more about each other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establishing norms and expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding and setting forward-looking goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll elaborate on each goal below before jumping into action steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-more-about-each-other&quot;&gt;Learning more about each other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you don’t have to be friends with your direct report. I repeat: you do not have to be friends with your direct report. &lt;strong&gt;But you need a good relationship with your direct report to be a good manager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning more about each other includes getting to know someone’s work and life views. We aren’t that great at keeping our personas separated. So you need to have &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; understanding so you have an insider’s look at each other’s instruction manuals. Otherwise, how are you going to know what you’re working towards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an introvert, I’ve found that a strategic order arrangement helps. It’s comically simple. Mine is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share something about myself &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with benign, surface-level information (e.g., your favorite cuisine).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask your direct report about the same information you spilled (e.g., their favorite cuisine).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rinse and repeat with deeper, more nuanced information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you share first? Because you can help ease into the conversation by being vulnerable and open first. But beware: do not misconstrue this as an excuse to control the conversation flow. It’s about vulnerability and openness. Not control and ego. In fact, as you get to know one another, the order should become irrelevant. It’s like any other relationship: The more comfortable you are with each other, the more the conversations zig, zag, tiki, and taka. I pat myself on the back when I reach this level with my direct reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a conversation I had with my new direct report, loosely from my memory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeji: “I recently started playing squash because I’m wildly out of shape. What do you do for fun?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura: “I play Ultimate on the weekends and I like to play board games.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeji: (&lt;em&gt;Trying to suppress excitement at a shared hobby so I don’t come across too eager&lt;/em&gt;) “I am obsessed with board games. Tell me more. What’s your favorite?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This topic went on for ages so I’ll do you a favor and omit the middle bits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeji: “I would love to have a game night with the team! I wonder what else we could do together as a team. What helps you bond with people at work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-norms-and-expectations&quot;&gt;Establishing norms and expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m cheating a little bit. One could argue that establishing norms and expectations is an extension of getting to know one another. I agree. But it’s too important not to call extra attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing more frustrating than trying to read someone’s mind. Here is a quick exercise to help illustrate how difficult mind reading is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close your eyes for a few seconds and think of what a gunslinging, western outlaw would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without&lt;/strong&gt; adding any details to the outlaw you’ve created in your head, answer the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s their eye color?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many buttons are on their shirt?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which side is the holster on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, you couldn’t answer all the questions. This mysterious outlaw only exists inside your head. You are its creator. And yet, here you are with unanswered questions. You’re having trouble with your mind’s eye even with a backstage pass. Other people don’t even have a ticket to the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What may be obvious to you may not be as obvious as you think. I thought everyone knew you could get a library card for free. I used to think buffalos actually had vestigial wings. Make things explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-and-setting-forward-looking-goals&quot;&gt;Understanding and setting forward looking goals.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to have a mutual understanding of how to achieve something together. There’s a cascade of goals, all intertwined into a mess. Your job is to collaborate with your direct report and help make sense of this beautiful mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the company goal. Most organizations have something, even if it’s not always a good goal. And by not good I mean Reese’s Puffs cereal: a saccharine, non-nutritional substance. Puff, fluff, faff. I’m not going to talk about the goodness of a company goal here (that’s a whole other subject). For now, I’m going to assume the company you chose to work for has a good goal. Clarify what this goal is with your direct report first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there’s the team goal. Your job is to help connect the dots between the company and the team goal(s). We all have parts we play in the jazz ensemble. What are we responsible for? Are we the percussion section that helps to keep the rhythm? Are we the woodwinds section that adds airy textures to the sound?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there’s the individual goal. Another connection you’re responsible for. You need to articulate how your direct report’s role, goals, and achievements fit with those of the rest of the team and the company. Got a new bass clarinetist in the woodwinds section for your jazz ensemble? Great. Emphasize how the low, earthy notes they produce will juxtapose with the zesty, brassy notes to create a complex, contrasting vibe for the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; goal. Not a typo: I meant to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that we’re all bad mind readers. My gunslinging outlaw from the previous exercise is a Chinese man who migrated to the U.S. during the gold rush, got swindled, and vowed to exact revenge on all who wronged him. The point is my outlaw is different from your outlaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your direct report’s goals on what they want to achieve, what they hope their legacy will be, and how they’ll make an impact at the company will differ from your interpretation. That might even differ from the goals the company has for the individual. Your job is to help marry them all together. Steer your direct report towards the most optimal way of satisfying company, team, and individual goals in a way that works for the company, the team, and the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparation-for-the-first-one-on-one&quot;&gt;Preparation for the first one-on-one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a common saying that one-on-ones are times reserved for the employees. “It’s their time to share what they’ve got on their minds.” I agree, but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t prepare. There’s another common saying in the U.S.—a wedding day is the bride’s special day. Imagine if your partner used this to get away from co-planning? Here, you dropped this: 🚩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prepare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;write your agenda ahead of time.&lt;/strong&gt; The agenda needs to include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A short description of its purpose;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bullet points of what will be covered;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goals and/or outcomes at the end of the meeting;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Materials distributed ahead of time, if necessary; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expectations on any pre-work to be done ahead of time, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;make one-on-one notes a living, collaborative artifact.&lt;/strong&gt; This allows for the relationship to grow with mutual effort–relationships strengthen through collaboration. It also makes it easy to see the progress of the growth, which is especially helpful when you have to recollect your thoughts while you write your performance review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found success in keeping my one-on-one notes in software like Google Doc, Microsoft Word on Office 365 (so the link is shareable instead of exchanging updated attachments every time), Notion, or Coda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;share your questions ahead of time.&lt;/strong&gt; This becomes especially useful if the questions merit more time for introspection. “Where do you want to be 5 years from now?” is pretty difficult to answer adequately when you’re on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-one-on-one-template&quot;&gt;First one-on-one template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the very first one-on-one, I like to share a slide deck and a prepared agenda to kick things off. As Elle Woods once said, “I think it gives it a little something extra.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First one-on-one template on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSOj5skPaUt-qMDRjKxDPg8sv1OwQyPNg-qUhiB2I6f1Rvx5E_3YMBSwWyNEpvr6SkN1k7-3w7trzjH/pub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First one-on-one slide deck on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xWoD1YTaRZ6D0Izc8ljUrEmRDPi6cMtC4ppdE3CE37U/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Slide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQL8cn_aaUuVCGFpG6Uv-XhLn6WUIvVENxl90Swve38Eq5c0Nrwl2YDDB7CyWAqHiN8LQbtuDIkrlKz/embed?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;569&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;after-the-first-one-on-one&quot;&gt;After the first one-on-one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huzzah! With the first one-on-one under your belt, the next step is to keep going. I’ve found that more frequent check-ins are beneficial at the onset. Check with your direct report to see how they’re feeling and adjust the recurrence accordingly. I’ve found weekly or bi-weekly check-ins should suffice once people feel settled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re holding your first or your hundredth one-on-one, the key to success is curiosity and openness: Share and care. Question and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is the Point of One-on-one Meetings?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think one-on-one meetings were tedious and ineffective. I used to shout into the void, “send it to me in an email! Or in slack! Stop wasting my time!” That is until I had two one-on-ones within a span of a month that made me reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first revelation came after my manager, let’s call him “Kenny,” submitted his notice. My project wasn’t going well and team attrition and morale were dismal. I was miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was puzzled as I headed into my final one-on-one with Kenny. Our usual agenda of status updates and silent head nods didn’t seem like a good use of our time. But having some parting thoughts from an outgoing manager seemed beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenny kicked it off. “The stakeholders don’t like you. As a product manager, you need to be the glue for the project. You should be more personable. If I were you, I’d take them out for drinks. Hope all goes well with your future endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was speechless. I ended our relationship with a curt, “okay, I’ll think about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I realized the following: First, one-one-ones are tedious, ineffective, &lt;em&gt;and cruel&lt;/em&gt;. Second, it’s better to have one-on-ones without a paper trail. This way, you’ve got plausible deniability of your cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new boss, let’s call him “Neal,” came in and started holding meet-and-greets with his teams and stakeholders. Bitter, broken, and dejected, I put off talking to Neal alone for as long as I could. I thought, “He heard the feedback already. He’s gonna hear what I have to say as a pathetic excuse. I need to have a win to debunk the hearsay. I’ll avoid him until then.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This maneuver only lasted a few weeks after he settled in. He scheduled a one-on-one with me which threw me into full panic mode. Days leading up to the meeting, I penned what I would say so I wouldn’t sound defensive. I also repeated to myself how I wouldn’t bring up the elephant in the room unless he broached it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head Game:&lt;/strong&gt; Your anxiety and paranoia are steering you in the right direction. People &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; easily swayed into believing everything they hear &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they talk badly about you. Always. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Reality:&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Pronia is when you feel like people are conspiring to cheer you on and help you succeed. The fact of the matter is, the world isn’t quite black and white. No good or bad. But for every awful person setting off your paranoia, there’s someone who’s in your court. Seek those people out instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s going on?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched into a project status update, per usual. I can’t remember the exact word-vomit, but it was something like, “The project is behind schedule. We’ve hit unforeseen complexities with…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No. I heard what others had to say. What’s going on?” I went off script. “Stakeholders don’t like me. This project isn’t going well.” At that moment, I thought, “Screw it. I can find another job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How are you feeling?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” This was a foreign question to me, and I didn’t know how to answer it. At the time I thought, “I’m wiping away tears like a schoolgirl. In front of a new boss. Who only knows me through negative feedback. And I all but confirmed it to be true. He’s either dumb or satisfying some weird power move. I feel like utter shit. What do you think?” He glanced at me, waited for a beat, and started to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If one person can cause a project to spiral, then it’s not set up very well, is it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head Game:&lt;/strong&gt; If you drop the ball, the team will fail. People will blame you. That’s why 8-hour work day isn’t enough, and you have to be a team player. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Reality:&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a team effort. From those who are executing to those who manage and lead. Everyone has a role to play, but the burden and responsibility must be shared. If it isn’t, it’s an organizational issue. So a be a team player, sign off, and prioritize your mental health. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neal glossed over his rhetorical question, got up to the whiteboard, and motioned me to do the same. He asked me to draw concentric circles of stakeholders. The most vocal stakeholders went in the center circle. The least vocal individuals occupied the outer edges. He tasked himself with the same exercise. With his circles, the most influential individuals—the decision makers, the one who controls the budget—made up the core. The least influential members surrounded the outer rim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/2022/concentric.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Notes on concentric circles of influence and voice in an organization&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained that comparing our two sets of concentric circles will help us understand if we are listening to the right people. Neal also informed me that the chart should identify who should be talking with whom. “We can visualize actual versus perceived influence. Then you and I can divide and conquer to win people over at different levels of the organization. That’s how we’ll get our project in a better state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one-on-ones following our meet-and-greet mirrored this format. He would first ask me what was going on. Then he would ask how I was feeling. We would then jump to constructive brainstorming followed by action items assigned to both of us. Often, Neal would check his notes and follow up on where we last left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks in, he brought up how “work is no different than high school with cliques and bullies sometimes. It would help to get to know the people you’re working with outside of work. Only if you’re comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then don’t. That’s fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the same suggestion that Kenny had brought up mere weeks ago. Only, with Neal, it didn’t seem so dissatisfying. I didn’t feel indignant. He respected the boundaries I set for myself without judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a conversation with Kenny, who I thought knew me well, I felt alone and worthless. But after a conversation with Neal, who didn’t know me at all, I felt supported, cared for, and respected. With Neal, I learned that you don’t have to know the individual personally to support and coach them. Compassion and care is all you need to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head Game:&lt;/strong&gt; You need to know your direct report personally in order to best support, help, and coach. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Reality:&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t need to know someone personally to want the best for them. You just have to care. This also means you don’t have to be friends with your direct reports or colleagues to wish them the best and help them grow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reclaimed my time, voice, and confidence in one-on-ones with Neal, we seldom had tactical “shop” talk. Status updates became irrelevant; he trusted me to make the right day-to-day decisions. Instead, our time together became a chance to exchange, expand, and align on our thoughts about the team vision, strategy, and our roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, &lt;em&gt;just send it to me in an email&lt;/em&gt; is still very much my de facto sentiment for most meetings. Email, Slack, and Team messages help winnow the simple exchanges. One-on-ones are then left with private, thought-provoking conversations. Or serve as a much-needed intermission to catch a breath and chat about something silly. With the right approach, one-on-ones can be the best opportunity for both parties to learn, grow, and care for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a story about a one-on-one gone right? Or wrong? &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reach out and share&lt;/a&gt; them with me. I’d love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Be a First-time Manager</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Your hard work has paid off, and you’re now a first-time manager. Hurray! It’s an exciting, nerve-racking transition. It’s also mired with uncertainty and doubt as you navigate this journey. And chances are, you haven’t received formal training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you become a good first-time manager? Here are seven tips based on my experience. If you have any other helpful tips, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;please reach out&lt;/a&gt;. I’d love to exchange thoughts and chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;really-listen&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; listen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings have always bombarded my schedule, and I typically hear enough to engage. It’s low effort but it works because people love hearing themselves. Don’t do this with your direct reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing is passive. Listening is active. Take the words at face value. Pause before interpreting, judging, or evaluating. Stop letting your mind run towards what you’ll say in response. Stop hearing, start listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My direct report once told me they were stressed from my micromanagement. I had a ton of thoughts scurry past me at 100 mph: “What the hell? I hate micromanagers. I’ve never asked them what they do with their day. Have they even met other micromanagers? I’ll respond with, ‘I hear you, but I don’t understand,’ so they don’t feel like I’m dismissing this completely. Wonder what they’re actually unhappy with instead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I micromanaged. I would’ve known sooner if I listened. It took their leave and another year for me to realize I messed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ask-exploratory-questions&quot;&gt;Ask exploratory questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking questions pairs so well with active listening. Ask questions to better understand your direct reports’ intentions. Be a fact-finder. Be an investigator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a good investigator is a great way to find customer problems to solve as a product manager. Being a good investigator allows for greater understanding and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies to being a people manager. Probe to understand motives and thought processes instead of actions and execution processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Try this:&lt;/mark&gt; Instead of asking “What are you prioritizing?” ask: “How are you thinking through prioritization?” This provides you with informative data points and opportunities for more dialogues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How they prioritize tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How they perceive their contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How well you’ve conveyed your expectations, goals, and the vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Segue to align on prioritization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check and balance workload and care for your direct reports’ mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;convey-your-thoughts-simply&quot;&gt;Convey your thoughts simply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had to read Ernest Hemingway in high school, I found it a chore. How did he become a respected writer? By stitching together common words into short sentences? Balderdash! A complete gobbledygook! A disparaging example of American literature! The inner critic in me thought he had zero flourish and bland rhetoric. Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Any damn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple.” &lt;cite&gt;― Pete Seeger ―&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much more difficult to be concise and profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop practicing the art of bullshitting. Use short sentences to introduce and share your thoughts. Make it easy to skim your writing. Consider the key pieces of information you want to convey before you communicate. It’s okay to say “I need to think about this more.” That’s a complete thought. There’s no reason to improvise in hopes you stumble into brilliant prose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop-trying-to-keep-score&quot;&gt;Stop trying to keep score&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read any relationship article on tallying up and you’ll get the same answer: Stop. Stop tallying up when you were right and they were wrong. Stop tallying up when they’ve made mistakes. Stop tallying up all the late nights you’ve put in and they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to notice and compare. It’s human to keep score for the nonsensical game you’re playing in your head. For me, it’s an act of self preservation. I’m the hero in my story. And I can prove my title is well-deserved. Look at my scoreboard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with people management, it’s not about you. It’s certainly not you versus your direct report. What do you get by having a higher score than your direct report? You can bask in the fact that you’re right and they’re wrong. What a shoddy employee, you think. Who is their lousy manager? Well done. You played yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-your-job-to-make-their-job-easier&quot;&gt;Do &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; job to make &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; job easier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, managers often promote high performing individual contributors. Those contributors becoming first-time managers need to be extra cautious. Excelling at your old job doesn’t mean you’ll excel at managing others who now do that job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a good chef doesn’t guarantee that you’ll run a restaurant well. In fact, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; being a good chef may be a restaurateur’s downfall. So if you’re like me and you’ve thought about running a food truck because you make mean braised short ribs, you may want to reconsider. For one, I hate driving big cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go from contributor to manager, your job is no longer confined to what you used to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: As a software developer, you need to produce quality code. As a manager, you need to help software developers produce quality code. Your job as a manager isn’t exclusive to reviewing their lines of code. You need to figure out how to unblock and foster creativity in your team. You need to make sure the team understands what they’re working towards and why. You need to speak up on your team’s behalf to ensure they feel heard if their work looks risky ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hold-yourself-accountable-first&quot;&gt;Hold yourself accountable first&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was wrong. I’m sorry.” Do these statements stir a visceral reaction? They do for me. One of my high school coaches once told me “It’s sad and funny to see you deny how wrong you are.” He was a jerk. But he was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually got used to saying these phrases for all the wrong reasons. They were a Get Out of Jail Free Card. I could maintain a veneer of humility by raising my hand and taking responsibility. Afterwards, I would slither away from the situation and receive praise for being open, honest, and brave. They were my ultimate deus ex machina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is plain manipulation. What you do &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; your words carries greater weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Try this:&lt;/mark&gt; The team made a mistake? Complete an introspection with yourself before demanding to know what happened. Here are some questions to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where were you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What was your participation like?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How did the team feel during the project?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What was your pulse on the progress leading up to the mistake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can you help set the next project up for success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to breed distrust as a first-time manager is blowing sycophantic, apologetic kisses upward and throwing “bring me solutions, not problems” accountability punches downward. It’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; team. Help them navigate out of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-be-a-jerk&quot;&gt;Don’t be a jerk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved the most obvious for last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a first-time manager is like cultivating any relationship. You don’t want to be friends with an Arrogant Adam who doesn’t listen, Talkative Tanner who talks &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; you, or Forgetful Frank who says, “Sorry, I thought I already gave you money for the bill we split” after drinking 3 more drinks than you (Every. Week. And &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; no Venmo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, you don’t want to be managed by an Arrogant Adam who tells you how to do it his way and never accepts new ideas, Talkative Tanner who still insists on talking at you, or Forgetful Frank who says, “Sorry, I thought that you would be happy with this expanded responsibility and we agreed you aren’t yet ready for the next level” after 3 glowing performance reviews without tangible, actionable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Try this:&lt;/mark&gt; My self-assessment on whether I’m a jerk manager is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will this meeting/project/email/presentation help me?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will this meeting/project/email/presentation help my team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an easier time coming up with answers to question 1 versus 2, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be acting like a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
